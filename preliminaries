Flutter is an open source framework by Google which can be used to build applications multiple platforms. 
It is a cross-platform UI toolkit that is designed to allow code reuse across operating systems such as iOS and Android, 
while also allowing applications to interface directly with underlying platform services. The goal is to enable developers to 
deliver high-performance apps that feel natural on different platforms, embracing differences where they exist while sharing as 
much code as possible.

Resources For Installing Flutter Sdk (when installing, be sure to take note of your directory you place flutter):
windows: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
macos: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos
or
2. git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
Currently, flutter installs WITH the Dart Sdk, so you should not need to install the Dart sdk for flutter. But for other IDEs.
Resourse For Installing Dart Sdk:
1. https://dart.dev/get-dart
////////////////////////////////////////////
For Android, you should also install Android Studio from:
////////////////////////////////////////////
Source with detailed instructions: https://developer.android.com/studio/install
-note: pay close attention to instructions for installation to ensure proper install
-After Android Studio installed, add an android emulator in Android Studio, for later use:

Adding A Android Virtual Device (AVD)
-Using Android Studio
1. After successfully installing Android Studio
2. Open Android Studio
3. Need to access the Android Device Manager (ADM)
4. After opening ADM, click on button labeled "Create Virtual Device...". It will
open a Virtual Device Configuration dialog box.
5. In the far-left column, select the emulator type Category, e.g. Phone
6. In the next column over, select an emulator that you would like to use: e.g. Pixel 4 (with Play Store)
7. Then, click "Next". It will open a dialog box with a list of emulator system images, showing
info like Release Name, API Level.
8. Allow the default selection, e.g. R, API Level = 30, ABI = x86
9. With a selected image, click "Next" button. It will take you to another dialog that allows you to provide
a custom emulator name.
10. click "Finish", and the emulator will be install at the system level for use with Android Studio, VSC, etc.

Adding Flutter to environment variables to run flutter commands from any directory
Easiest way on windows:
Open a command terminal and enter:
rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables 
add to "path" environment variable path of flutter\bin , e.g. "C:\src\flutter\bin" or where this bin folder is located 
if dart sdk path is needed, also add it. e.g. add to path "C:\tools\dart-sdk\bin" or wherever this bin folder was placed
==You likely have to close and reopen any existing console windows for these changes to take effect.===

On Mac:
$ export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
